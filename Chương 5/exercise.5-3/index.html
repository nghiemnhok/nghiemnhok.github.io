<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>

<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>

<p>Location: Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>

<p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
